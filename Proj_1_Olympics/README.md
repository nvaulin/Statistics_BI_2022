The dataset is adapted by course instructor from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

This project is the first project in the course on statistics at the Bioinformatics Institute. 
In this project, you can see the standard techniques for exploratory data analysis, dealing with NA
and testing basic statistical hypotheses. Among the statistical tests, here is the use of such tests as: 

- Student's t-test
- Shapiro-Wilk test
- Levene test
- Contingency tables analysis using Pearson's chi-square test
